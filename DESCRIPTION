Description: Proposed by Harrell, the C index or concordance C, is considered an overall measure of discrimination in survival analysis between a survival outcome that is possibly right censored and a predictive-score variable, which can represent a measured biomarker or a composite-score output from an algorithm that combines multiple biomarkers. This package aims to statistically compare two C indices with right-censored survival outcome, which commonly arise from a paired design and thus resulting two correlated C indices.
